      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>How does DuckDuckGo make money?</h3>
        <p>
          We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other
          search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled about you using
          your personal information like search, browsing, and purchase history.
          Since we don’t collect that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are
          based on the search results page you are viewing, not on you as a
          person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about
          cars. <a href="#">Learn more.</a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>What does Google know about me?</h3>
        <p>
          Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default,
          their trackers have been found on 75% of the top million websites,
          which means they are tracking most everywhere you go on the Internet
          (unless you stop them with DuckDuckGo!). And that’s just the tip of
          the iceberg. <a href="#">Learn more</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Why use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?</h3>
        <p>
          Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part
          because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers on millions of
          websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t track your
          searches and our
          <a href="#">DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app</a> block
          Google’s (and many other companies’) trackers across the Internet,
          helping to keep your browsing history more private, as it should be.
          And that’s just the beginning — by using DuckDuckGo you also escape
          the manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster
          (after all that tracking code is disabled).

      <div class="question">
        <h3>How do DuckDuckGo search results compare to Google’s?</h3>
        <p>
          DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without
          tradeoffs in result quality. We have everything you’ve come to expect
          in an online search experience, and a few
          <a href="#">bonus features</a> that make searching the Internet not
          only private, but also a bit more fun! And, on top of that, because
          there is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble
          of manipulated results. <a href="Learn more">Learn more</a>.

      <div class="question">
        <h3>
          What’s the difference between using DuckDuckGo and Incognito mode?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called
          “Incognito” mode. In fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes
          information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from
          saving your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service
          providers, or governments from being able to track you across the
          Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous and
          if you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you private when
          browsing off of search results. <a href="#">Learn more</a>.
        </p>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>How popular is DuckDuckGo?</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t track our users, so it’s actually impossible for us to know
          how many users in total are using our products. However, we are able
          to make an estimate based on the number of searches we get per month,
          <a href="#">which we make public</a>. Our best guess — over 50 million
          people! <a href="#">Learn more</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>How does the DuckDuckGo app & extension work?</h3>
        <p>
          The DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser mobile app and Privacy Essentials
          desktop extension both come with our best-in-class tracker blocker,
          encryption enforcer, and private search engine – all in one simple
          package. This gives you all the key privacy protection tools to search
          and browse privately, curbing the constant monitoring of your Internet
          activity by companies like Google and Facebook.
